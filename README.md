# Rock, Paper, Scissors



Rock, Paper Scissors is a digital game that leaves no chance of luck. The player has the option to pick either the Rock, Paper, or Scissors button. It is to be played against the computer, which randomly generates an answer from the three buttons dislayed on the screen. Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors. Rock beats scissors, but loses to Paper, and Scissors beats Paper, but loses to Rock. The winners score will increment by one and the game can then be played again. The first player to reach a score of three wins the round. 

The games desig is minimal to make it's usage appropriate for people of any age!

# Credits

- I used Matt Rudge's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK6caj8bfI) as inspiration for my project. Specifically, I used the block of code demonstrated in his video to make the game run once a button is clicked.

- I also used (https://chat.openai.com/c/0f2d1c66-09a6-468f-8e6e-a3f83c472b7f) throughout to debug. It was able to help me fix an issue I had in my code which was prevnting the computer choice being random.

- I used (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK6caj8bfI) as inspiration for my game design. I customised it to fit my own game design which was slightly different from the one displayed in the video.

# Deployment 

- I used https://www.gitpod.io/ and deployed early to https://github.com/ very early on in the development of the project. This meant I could sent my website to my tutor, friends and family to test the project for bugs at every stage throughout the project.
- The steps to deploying the website are as followed 
  - In the github repository, go to the setting tab.
  - Select the Master Branch from the source section dropdown menu.
  - Now, the page should provide a completed link to the website.
